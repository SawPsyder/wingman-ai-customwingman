# Custom Wingman for Wingman AI by ShipBit

We are flattered to present to you our version of a great trading assistant.

## Version: v8

Works with: Wingman AI 1.1.2b1 & 1.1.3b1

If you have any feedback, please leave it here: [Discord Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1173573578604687360/1179594417926066196/1185567252184047656)

## What data is this based on?

This wingman is based on a data dump we retrieve from the [uexcorp API](https://uexcorp.space/api.html). As the data is just a collection of ship, location and commodity information, we are able to do all our trading route calculation locally in python. This comes with some benefits, like faster responses and better customizability but does also bring some disadvantages in the form of missing data output like expected trading durations and distance calculation and sometimes does recommend buying more SCU than available. So our trading routes are currently purely based on profit per run. Sometimes its good to ask for multiple routes and select the one you like.

## How to set it up?

1. Download the files from this repository.
2. Either just copy our `config.yaml` and overwrite yours or just copy the uexcorp wingman part from the bottom of our `config.yaml` file to your `config.yaml` (starting with `uex-corp:`). While doing that, you might also want to change some settings like the `record_key` or `tts_provider` and other settings. We also have some custom settings you can change what they do is written above all of them in a comment. But of course you can also change everything you can change on every other default wingman!
3. Copy our `uex_corp_wingman.py` file into your `_internal\wingmen` folder.
4. Get your own uexcorp API key [here](https://uexcorp.space/api.html). On first launch you will be asked for it.
5. Enjoy and feel free to leave us feedback [here](https://discord.com/channels/1173573578604687360/1179594417926066196/1185567252184047656) ðŸ™‚

## What can I do then?

### Ask for the best trading route

This gives you the best trading route for your available money and cargo space.

- **ship name** (required, just the name without manufacturer. So "Cutlass Black" for example)
- **current location** Anything like Stanton, Hurston, Yela, Area 18, ...
- target position (Traveling from Hurston to Arccorp? Maybe you should take something with you if your are flying there anyway!)
- budget
- free cargo space (if not given, the ships cargo space is used. But got just 56 SCU free in your Caterpillar? -> give this info then.)
- commodity (Want to trade something specific like gold?)
- illegal commodities (Dont want to trade drugs? Then tell it not to give you these trading routes.)

### Ask for one or more multiple trading routes

This gives you a list of trading routes with different commodities.

- Same parameters as "Ask for the best trading route"
- And the optional number of provided routes. (Default: 2)

### Ask for one or more best selling/buying location

Got something with you or want to buy something? Find the best price!

- **Commodity name** (e.g. Iron)
- ship name
- current location (It will search in your given area. If nothing is found there, it will provide the best location overall.)
- amount (Got 52 SCU of something? Give that information and get estimated selling price of your cargo.)

### Ask for ship information

Gives you some basic information about a ship and where to buy it.

- **ship name** (Just the name without manufacturer. So "Cutlass Black" for example)

### Ask for ship comparison

Gives you some basic information about multiple ships and points out differences.

- **ship names** (Just the name without manufacturer. So "Cutlass Black" and "Freelancer Max" for example. You can also mention a series. Like "Constellation")

### Ask for location information

Gives you some basic information and buy/sell offers of a location.

- **location name** (Anything like Stanton, Hurston, Yela, Area 18, ...)

### Ask for commodity information
